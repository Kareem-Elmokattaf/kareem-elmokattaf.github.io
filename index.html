       <h4 class="headers" >Introduction</h4>
       <p style="text-align: justify">
          Hello there, my name is Kareem Elmokattaf (bonus points if you can say my last name). I am a Mechatronics engineering graduate from McMaster University. Since my graduation I have rejoined Husky Technologies, where I did a 16 month co-op, as an Electrical Designer.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify">
          Since rejoining, I have had more of an interdisciplinary department role where I have been working with the software team to help develop, fix and update tools for the electrical team. While doing so, I have had an increase in passion for programming which I have been acting on. Through this passion, I have taken on the initiative to create and maintain tools for the electrical team to help improve productivity and efficiency.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify">
          The first project I have worked was very critical to improving efficiency not just for the electrical team, but the other production departments (mechanical and software). To give a little bit of a background, our customers when ordering a machine might order what we label as a "special". The "special" is a, as the name says, a special request that the customer would like to have on the machine. Whether that be a specific color or a specific function, there is a lot of variety that comes with it. These specials have been in the company since the start of 2010, and ongoing. When creating a new project, in order to ensure that we have the right information and that our newer projects match those of the older projects, we would use those already existing projects as a reference. Considering that there have been 14 years and counting worth of projects, that is an extremely large dataset to go through and try and find information. This information was also not readily available as it was all on excel or word documents. So I created a tool using C# that would go through all the folders of all the projects since 2010, it would read through the excel or word file and collect the information from there. While doing so, it would gather all the necessary information about the special and the project where the special was requested. This information would then be stored in an SQL database. After the tool has finished going through all the files, you can quickly search for the special you want to see a reference for. The user can use either the special name, the special number, keywords that are in the special and many other ways to find the special's reference. This helped reduce the time wasted searching through multiple word documents and excel files by more than 100 times. What used to take hours, now takes a minute to find.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify">
          Continuing to learn more and develop myself and my skills further has made me realize what I am capable of. As an example, over the last academic year, I have improved my ability in building and understanding circuits. I always struggled to understand how to build circuits even with the help of a lot of online resources. But over the course of the past year, I decided to make it my goal to learn how to build and understand circuits. With the collaboration of my classmates and TA's I understood how circuits are built and how they work. This is one of the goals that I have set myself for the year and I am glad to have met that goal.</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify">
          After successfully competing in my "Android App Development" course using the online initiative, One Million Arab Coders, I have decided to start learning machine learning. The learning process will be tedious but I am up for the challenge. After spending a few days learning machine learning and how it works, I have developed my first machine learning program.<p>
       <p style="text-align:justify">
          This is my webpage that I am currently working on improving. There is going to be a lot of work on this webpage which I am very excited to share with you. This webpage will continue to improve as I continue to learn more about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and PHP to make this webpage more appropriate and better.</p>

Our system manipulated the letters inputted by the user on an HTML webpage into google's predictive texting to predict the words being typed. When the client had formed the sentence, pressing "Enter" would make the system run google's text to speech API. </p>

The GUI also provided the ability to change modes and parameters for the pacemaker to fit each user's needs.</p>

We made a hole in a cup to insert the metal. The oscilloscope would tell us if there was metal in the cup by the change in the graph presented on the oscilloscope.</p>
